# The_Music_Tank

# I and another UT Austin Nick Remelius created a completely interactive website that described everything you need to know about Texas music since the 1900s. 

# The website implemented the following coding languages and technical implementations:

# 1. HTML and CSS to create the webpages
# 2. Javascript to make the webpages interactive
# 3. PHP, SQL, and MySQL to interact with a database that stored Texas cities, music genres, songs, and artists for the website

# Using all of these coding languages, the following webpages were created:

# 1. Home Page
# 2. Interactive Texas Map where users can press a city on the Texas map and learn about its music
# 3. A Texas Music form where users can enter new Texas music into the Texas Music database
# 4. A page giving information and history on Texas Latin Music
# 5. A page where regular users to the site can register and submit their favorite Texas Music 
# 6. Pages where you can learn more about the creators of the site and contact them
# 7. A page with all sources listed as a bibliography
