<br><h2 class="center">Popular Texas Music Over The Last Century</h2><br>



    <p class="center">Although Texas has a rich history of music that extends further back than 1920, for brevity, we will only be diving into the popular music in Texas over the last century.</p><br>







    <p><b>1920's: </b> During the decade of the roaring twenties, popular music in Texas included Jazz, Blues, Ragtime and Swing. All of these genres originated from the musical creativity of African Americans. 



            But around this time is where the first distinct style of music came out of Texas and that is the Western Swing. Western Swing is so unique to Texas because it includes elements of genres like Jazz, Blues and Latin rythyms. Western Swing and Jazz were the two most popular genres of music in Texas in the 1920's. </p><br>



    <p><b>1930's: </b> After the high of the roaring twenties came the Great Depression, and the most popular music of this decade built on the popular Jazz and Blues movement of the past decade. 



            Western Swing became more popular in Texas and surrounding states, along with a new distinct Texas music called Texas blues. Another style of music distinct to Texas also evolved in the 1930's called Boogie-Woogie, which incorporated Blues and Ragtime.</p><br>



    <p><b>1940's: </b> In the World War 2 era of Texas music history, a new type of music was evolving from Western Swing and Blues roots called Honky-Tonk. Texas artists like Gene Autry and Ernest Tubb were two of the most influential Honky-Tonk artists not only in Texas but in the whole United States.



            Originally, Honky-Tonk and Country music were referred to as 'folk' or 'hillbilly' music but near the end of the 1940's, the genres were rebranded as Western and Country and Honky-Tonk was a subgenre of Western. </p><br>



    <p><b>1950's: </b> During this decade in Texas music history, Rock and Roll started to evolve from a plethora of different genres like Blues, Jazz, Boogie-Woogie and Country music. The song 'Rock Awhile' by Houston, Texas native Goree Carter is widely considered to be the first Rock and Roll record, and that is only the start of Texas musicians' influence on the genre. 



            Artists like Buddy Holly and Roy Orbinson are two of Rock and Roll's earliest stars and have influenced generations of Texan artists after them</p><br>



    <p><b>1960's: </b> Rock and Roll continued it's cultural influence and popularity among the Texan population well into the 1960's with many new and popular Texan Rock artists like Janis Joplin and Roky Erickson. 



            The Rock and Roll movement of the 50's and early 60's transformed into a very popular genre in Texas and the rest of the country called Psychedelic Rock. It was during this decade that Rock and Roll overtook the mantle of most popular genre in Texas over the Country and Western genres.</p><br>



    <p><b>1970's: </b> This decade saw the decline of influence of Texas Blues in popular Texas music. However, there still was one popular genre of music in Texas called Outlaw Country that stuck with its Blues roots and incorporated Rock influence into its music. 



            During this decade, Southern Rock was booming and the movement was being led by Texas natives such as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. </p><br>



    <p><b>1980's: </b> The Outlaw Country music scene started to lose popularity in the 1980's but certain artists like ZZ-Top and Stevie Ray Vaughn were starting to incorporate Texas Blues into Rock and Roll which was gaining popularity throughout this decade. Hip-Hop music also started gaining popularity in Texas, notably through the group The Geto Boys which was the first big Hip-Hop group that was not based in the East or West coast.



            The Punk Rock music scene also started to gain popularity later in the decade in Texas from bands like Toadies who would influence somewhat the popular grunge era of the 90's.</p><br>



    <p><b>1990's: </b> During this decade, the Latin music scene in Texas blew up, resulting in the Texas based Tejano genre, mostly thanks to Tejano singer Selena Quintanilla, who is referred to as the queen of Tejano music. 



            She brought the genre more attention by writing one of the first hits that had lyrics in Spanish and English. Groups like San Angelo and Los Lonely Boys started adding older Texas Blues and Jazz influence into their Tejano style. 



            The Hip-Hop scene in Texas also gained massive popularity during this decade as Houston became one of the biggest Hip-Hop hubs in the country. </p><br>



    <p><b>2000's: </b> At the beginning of the new century, the internet was becoming bigger and bigger which meant more music was being shared and listened to than ever before in human history. And new Texas artists were still leading the way in musical revolution. 



            Pop music was becoming the most popular form of music and Houston's own Beyonce was the biggest name in pop music. However, as the Latino population continued to grow, so did the popularity of Latin music.</p><br>



    <p><b>2010's: </b> During this decade, the Hip-Hop genre was gaining much popularity in Texas with another Houston artist, Travis Scott, being one of the most popular artists in the world. During this decade, Texan artists like Selena Gomez and Kelly Clarkson have seen success during this decade in their respective genres. </p><br><br>
