        <h3>Inception and History of Latin Music:</h3><br>

            <p>Latin music in the Americas has a long and diverse history and is a result of many different cultural groups influencing this genre of music. 

            Latin music gets its roots from indigenous Americans who used many wind instruments in their music. 

            But this music was soon influenced by European explorers from Portugal and Spain who influenced the American continient with their languages. 

            This is why most Latin music has lyrics in either Spanish or Portuguese. 

            These European explorers also brought their music over with them, which blended with the indigenous music traditions. 

            Arguably the biggest influence on Latin music is the African influence.

            When African slaves were brought to the Americas, they also brought their musical traditions. 

            This mixture of different musical traditions resulted in famous latin rythyms like the samba and salsa.

        <h3>Genres of latin music in Texas:</h3><br>

            <p>There are many different types and styles of Latin music all across the world but there is one notable Latin genre that encapsulates Texas latin music and that is Tejano music. 

                This style of Latin music has latin influences from mariachi and Mexican cumbia but also has influence from music of the United States.

                There are three minor subsections of the Tejano style that include conjunto, orquesta and modern.

                Conjunto is a band that includes an accordian, 12 string guitar, electric bass and drums. 

                While an orquesta uses many of the same traditional band instruments, their distinct sound comes from their use of a brass orchestra. 

                And a modern Tejano band would use synths, drums and electric guitars and sometimes accordians.
